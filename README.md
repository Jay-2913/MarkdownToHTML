## Markdown to HTML Converter

This Python script demonstrates the conversion of Markdown text to HTML using the `markdown` library. The code takes a simple Markdown string as input and converts it to HTML, which is then printed to the console. This can be useful for applications that need to dynamically generate HTML content from Markdown sources.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the `markdown` library installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install markdown
```

### Usage

The script contains a sample Markdown string with a heading and bold text. Here's how it works:

1. **Import the `markdown` Library**:
   ```python
   import markdown
   ```

2. **Define the Markdown Text**:
   ```python
   markdown_text = "# Heading\n\n**Bold text**"
   ```

3. **Convert Markdown to HTML**:
   ```python
   html_text = markdown.markdown(markdown_text)
   ```

4. **Print the HTML Output**:
   ```python
   print(html_text)
   ```

### Example

Below is the full code of the script:

```python
import markdown

markdown_text = "# Heading\n\n**Bold text**"
html_text = markdown.markdown(markdown_text)
print(html_text)
```

### Output

When you run the script, the output will be:

```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p><strong>Bold text</strong></p>
```

### Conclusion

This script provides a basic example of how to convert Markdown to HTML using Python. It can be easily extended to handle more complex Markdown content and integrated into larger applications that require Markdown-to-HTML conversion.
